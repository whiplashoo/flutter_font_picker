## 1.2.1

* Feat: Filter display languages according to the active list of supported fonts. This eliminates languages from the list which there are no fonts supporting fonts present.
* Feat: Implemented option favorites feature which can be enabled by setting `showFavoriteButtons` to true.
* Feat: The `example\main.dart` example program has been enhanced to include a control panel that allows all possible options to `FontPicker()` to be played with and adjusted.  It also now includes a `useDevicePreview` constant that can be set to true to enable previewing `FontPicker()`'s behavior on a wide variety of possible flutter platforms, screensizes and device orientations.
* Feat:  Added ability to set font sizes and list preview text.
    - `previewSampleTextFontSize` - Font size used for preview sample text above list.
    - `fontSizeForListPreview`: Font size to use for each font name within font picker list.  (Optional list preview sample text also uses this size). Defaults to 14 (previously hardcoded).
    - `showListPreviewSampleTextInput` - Set whether to include form field to allow user to change the list preview sample text.
    - `listPreviewSampleText` - Optional sample text include to right of each font within picker list.
